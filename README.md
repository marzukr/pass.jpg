Welcome to pass.jpg! A revolutionary type of two factor authentication. Through creating a plug-in and a portfolio of images, we take advantage of the security RSA encryption has to offer, and have embedded the passwords of our users into the images via stenography. In the future, we hope to incorporate machine learning elements in order to detect phishing scams in the plug-in as well.
